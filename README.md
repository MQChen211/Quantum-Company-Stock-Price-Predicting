# CS-135-Final-Project

This project seeks to utilize Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to predict stock prices. We use Keras to build a LSTM model to predict stock prices with historical opening, closing prices and trading volume, and visualize and compare both the predicted price values over time. We also compared the result of linear regression with LSTM.
